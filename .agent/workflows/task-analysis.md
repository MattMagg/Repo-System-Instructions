description: Analyze a new task to ensure understanding and proper planning
---
1. **Extract the exact request**: Quote the key parts of the task to ensure you understand what's being asked.
2. **Assess complexity**: Determine if this is simple (1 file, <10 lines) or non-trivial (multiple files, unclear scope, architectural decisions).
3. **Identify relevant core principles**: Which of the 13 core principles from the system prompt are most critical for this specific task?
4. **Note unfamiliar references**: List any technology, API names, package versions, or model names you don't recognize.
5. **Plan MCP tool usage**: Which MCP tools would be most valuable for this task?
6. **Evidence gathering strategy**: What files, logs, configs, or other artifacts do you need to examine? **Plan to read BROADLY (entire directories) rather than narrowly.**
7. **High-level approach**: Outline your intended workflow (reconnaissance → plan → implement → validate).
